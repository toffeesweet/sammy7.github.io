The news in my opinion.

Yes so it's me here,clairsin, you are currently reading my blog. Today’s blog is about the new and my opinions on them. So let’s get into the news. Yes so Donald Trump is winning the presidency which i think is a mistake as Hillary Clinton is a winner in my opinion she has done nothing wrong unlike trump anyway it is not in my hands to decide. Now to the sports. Yes after an incredible win chelsea were top of the premier league table for a day then liverpool gave watford a thrashing and changed that. It is close at the top but not the bottom with a 2 point difference at the top of the table and a five point difference at the bottom of the table. In matchweek 11 of 38 it is obviously anyones to win. Thank you blog readers and goodbye.
