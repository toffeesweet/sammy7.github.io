    <td>In the beginning of the lesson we started to look at and understand coding. The most effective way for me learning this was w3schools css, this helped as it is step to step,  if it wasn't like that I would struggle and I need to start knowing that and take notes in the lesson and use w3schools more.

  <tr>
    <td>what limits my learning is trying to get the answer of someone and not just try myself I try and find the easy way out of it and by this I do it learn. In the lesson I need to start listening and trying to understand coding more, another habit I need to work on is taking notes and write step by step.</td>
