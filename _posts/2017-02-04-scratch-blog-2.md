    <td>What went well: How did I learn? What helped me learn today? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Even better if…: What could I do that would be even better? Improvements? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could keep my head down and work harder especially when things are going wrong this would mean that i would at least complete some of my target.</td>
