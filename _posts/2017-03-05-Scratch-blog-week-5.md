**Evaluation of Learning This Lesson**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What went well: How did I learn? What helped me learn today? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What helped me learn today was that i kept my head down and tried to work hard on my coding of my aim of the game button.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Even better if…: What could I do that would be even better? Improvements? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What i could've done which would have been better was just duplicating the code from my other buttons instead i did each bit of code at once whereas if i duplicated my other buttons my time would’ve been halved and i could’ve reached both my goals instead of only one.</td>
  </tr>
