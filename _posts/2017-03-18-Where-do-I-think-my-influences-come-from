# Where do I think my influences come from?

I think my influences come from multiple places, for example my parents as since a young age they have told me what is right and what is wrong like swearing is wrong and saying please and thank you is right, another example would be Media, like the news has taught me what is normal to happen and what is not and like the newspaper for the same reasons, Social Media has influenced my friendships as i see a lot of things that has happened to people i know and if i want to make something a conversation I can start easily without hesitation. Another example would be the TV because as a young kid shows like Phineas and Ferb taught me how to be creative and what could be a good idea and what makes a good idea, also shows that were more about learning got me to where i am now. Life experiences too as these have taught me that if i make a mistake i have to try and find a way to get unstuck. As well as all these influences that helped my intelligence there is sport which has taught me respect and sportsmanship these two things help in life as you need respect to give to your family members and to your teachers and anyone in general.
